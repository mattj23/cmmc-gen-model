# CMMC/NIST SP 800-171 Model Generator

This repository contains python scripts which will fetch documents and use them to build a structured model of the requirements, assessment methods, and supporting information associated with the Department of Defense's CMMC assessment implementation.  This model can then be used by systems and tools meant to aid in achieving compliance.

The following elements which are retrieved and built into the model:

* The CMMC 2.0 Model and mapping to NIST SP 800-171
* The NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 controls
* The NIST SP 800-171A assessment methodologies
* The mapping between NIST SP 800-171 and NIST SP 800-53
* The control catalogs for NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4 and Rev 5
